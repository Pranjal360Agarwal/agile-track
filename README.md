# agile-track

Welcome to the Agile Project Management Dashboard, a personal project I built to streamline and manage project workflows for agile teams. The dashboard provides features such as task management, Gantt charts for tracking timelines, and robust user authentication via AWS Cognito. This project integrates modern frontend and backend technologies, with a cloud infrastructure for scalability and performance.


# ðŸš€ Technology Stack

## Frontend:

â€¢ Next.js: A React framework for server-rendered apps.
â€¢ Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling and rapid UI development.
â€¢ Redux Toolkit: For state management.
â€¢ Redux Toolkit Query: For API data fetching.
â€¢ Material UI Data Grid: For table and data display components.


## Backend:

â€¢ Node.js with Express: The core backend server for handling API requests.
â€¢ Prisma ORM: An ORM for managing PostgreSQL database connections and queries.
â€¢ Database:
â€¢ PostgreSQL: A relational database managed through Prisma.
â€¢ PgAdmin: For easy PostgreSQL database management.

## Cloud Services (AWS):

â€¢ AWS EC2: For hosting the backend server.
